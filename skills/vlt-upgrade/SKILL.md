# Vault Module Upgrade

## Overview

A vault **grows into itself** — it mints its own `vlt-agent-*` partners, adds local convention overlays, accrues mint and decision history. But the generic, module-agnostic installer that refreshes the shipped bundle has **no concept of that vault-specific evolution** and can silently destroy or deregister it. `vlt-upgrade` is the skill that owns the lifecycle so the upgrade is **durable**: shipped things refresh, vault-specific things survive.

The governing idea (operating contract, *Durability across upgrades*): **two classes of evolution, two fates.** Generic state refreshes from the bundle; vault-specific state lives in the agent zone (`_agent/`, never overwritten) or is reconciled by **merge, never replace**.

**Two ways the new bits arrive — prefer to own the apply, degrade to bracket.** The upgrade is two welded jobs: *acquire* the new module bits and *apply* them to the vault.

- **Happy path — own the apply.** If the updated module source is reachable (a local path, the BMad module cache, a checkout), `vlt-upgrade` **merge-copies** the shipped `vlt-*` skills and governance into the install itself — refreshing shipped files, never touching unshipped `vlt-agent-*` dirs or the agent zone. **No destruction occurs.** This is the preferred path and the owner's ideal: vlt-upgrade owns the upgrade end-to-end.
- **Fallback — bracket the installer.** If the bits arrive only by running the generic installer (which copies destructively), `vlt-upgrade` runs **pre-flight first** (snapshotting while the vault is intact), lets the installer run, then **reconciles after** to restore/re-register what the installer dropped.

Either way the reconcile logic is identical. `vlt-upgrade` **calls `vlt-setup`** for provisioning — it never reimplements it.

## On Activation

Load config from `{project-root}/_bmad/config.yaml` and `{project-root}/_bmad/config.user.yaml` (root level and the `vlt` section). If the module isn't set up (no `vlt` config or `_meta` governance), tell the user to run `vlt-setup` first — there is nothing to upgrade.

Resolve paths through the `vault_structure` map (override wins, else shipped default). Logical names used (default, relative to the project root): `conventions` → `_meta/conventions/`, `overlays` → `_agent/conventions/` (overlays + the stock `.baseline/`), `personas` → `_meta/personas/`, `contract` → `_meta/vault-operating-contract.md`, `upgrade_ledger` → `_agent/upgrade-ledger.md`, `specs` → `_agent/specs/`. The **live skills dir** is `{project-root}/.claude/skills/`; the **live workflows dir** is `{project-root}/.claude/workflows/`. Below, `{overlays}` etc. mean the resolved path.

Determine the **module source** (where the new bits live) — ask the user for the path if it isn't obvious, or detect the BMad module cache. If no reachable source exists and the user will run the installer themselves, take the **bracket** path (pre-flight now; reconcile after they confirm the installer ran).

## Step 1 — Pre-flight (always, from the living vault)

Run this **before any destructive step**, while the vault is intact — its snapshot is the restore source. Capture the **divergence snapshot**:

- **Minted partners** — every `vlt-agent-*` dir under the live skills dir whose code is **not** a shipped agent in the **incoming module source's** `module.yaml agents[]` (the version being installed — librarian / researcher / creative are shipped; anything else was minted locally). Determine shipped-ness from the pristine **incoming/bundled** source, **not** the live installed `module.yaml`: a local mint may historically have written itself into the live `agents[]` (an older `vlt-mint` Step 4 once told partners to — now corrected), which would misclassify it as shipped and drop it from this snapshot, voiding its B2 body-restore (Step 3 item 2). This mirrors B1's own test — `merge-help-csv.py` keys shipped-ness off the bundled source, not the live manifest, so B1 is already immune; this closes the same gap in B2. **Bracket-path fallback:** on the own-the-apply path the incoming source is in hand at pre-flight, so run the pristine check directly; on the bracket path where the incoming source isn't reachable yet (Step 0), fall back to the known-shipped set (librarian / researcher / creative) / live manifest for this pre-flight snapshot and **re-verify shipped-vs-local at reconcile**, once the incoming manifest is present (the bracket path already defers reconciliation post-install). Record dir path + its help-registry row(s).
- **Convention overlays** — every `{overlays}/*.overlay.md` (vault-local additions, durable — must never be lost).
- **Base convention divergence** — for each `{conventions}/{name}.md`, compare to its stock baseline `{overlays}/.baseline/{name}.md`. A base that **differs** from its baseline was hand-edited locally (it should have been an overlay or upstreamed) — record it as divergence (do **not** silently clobber it; the refresh will overwrite the base, so surface this so the local change isn't lost unnoticed). If a baseline is missing, record `baseline_missing` (can't classify — seed it from the incoming source this run, best-effort).
- **Skill-asset divergence** — the shipped-skill analogue of base divergence, using the manifest `{overlays}/.baseline/.skill-manifest` (written by `vlt-setup`). For each file the manifest records, recompute its SHA against the live copy: a file whose SHA **differs** was hand-edited locally (it should have been upstreamed) — record it as divergence and **copy its current content into this working note** (only the diverged files, so nothing is lost when the refresh overwrites it). If the manifest is **missing** (a pre-0.6.0 install), record `skill_manifest_missing` and seed it best-effort from the incoming source this run — the same handling as `baseline_missing` above. This is the net that turns a local skill-asset edit into a surfaced divergence instead of a silent clobber (e.g. a vault's local `vlt-mint/assets/*` template edits).
- **Mint history** — confirm `_agent/mint/decision-log.md` and any `_agent/mint/{date}-{slug}.md` planning docs exist (agent-zone; expected to survive untouched — recorded for the ledger).
- **Capabilities** — every vault-grown light capability under `{partners}/*/capabilities/*.md` and every family contract under `{capabilities}/families/*.md` (agent-zone; must survive untouched). Note which families are **shipped** (their invariants may change upstream — see reconcile) vs vault-grown.
- **Governance edits** — the operating contract / personas that differ from their shipped versions.

Write this snapshot to a working note and **append the opening half of a ledger entry** (Step 5).

**Derive-first invariant.** The preserve set is derived from the **live vault, every run** — never read from the prior ledger entry, which records what a *past* upgrade found, not what *this* one must protect. (A vault grows between upgrades — new capabilities, minted skills, families — that a stale inventory would silently drop.) This is the same **derive-first discipline** the enforcement counters follow — counters derive from the event records, never a stored tally; here the preserve inventory derives from disk, never the prior ledger. Two concrete homes, one discipline.

## Step 2 — Apply (own it, or bracket)

- **Own the apply (preferred):** merge-copy from the module source into the install — refresh the shipped `vlt-*` skills, the governance bundle (`_meta/`), and the workflows (`.claude/workflows/*.js`). **Refresh shipped files only**; never delete an unshipped `vlt-agent-*` dir, never write into the agent zone, never overwrite an `{overlays}/*.overlay.md`. Base conventions **are** refreshed (they are pristine by design — local edits live in overlays); a base recorded as locally-diverged in Step 1 is refreshed too, but its prior content is preserved in the ledger and flagged in the post-flight report for the user to re-express as an overlay or upstream. **Shipped skill assets** are treated the same way: a skill file recorded as locally-diverged in Step 1 (per `skill_asset_divergence`) is refreshed too, but its prior content — captured in the Step-1 working note — is preserved in the ledger and flagged in the post-flight report for the user to re-apply locally or upstream (skills have no overlay mechanism, so a local skill edit is the user's to re-apply). The skill manifest itself is refreshed to the new shipped versions by the Step-6 provision hand-off (it is module-owned in `vlt-setup`).
  - **Exclude dev cruft from the copy.** The merge-copy reads from the module *working tree*, which can carry build-time authoring artifacts that are gitignored from the repo but present on disk — chiefly per-skill **`.decision-log.md`** (BMad `phase: build` records). These must **never** land in a vault: a stray `.decision-log.md` would overwrite the installed `vlt-mint` relocation stub and reintroduce the clobber-prone mint-log location that §A1 retired. **Exclude `.decision-log.md`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.DS_Store`, and `reports/` from everything copied** (e.g. `rsync --exclude='.decision-log.md' --exclude='__pycache__/' --exclude='*.pyc' --exclude='.DS_Store' --exclude='reports/'`, or filter them out of any `cp`-based copy). Build cruft is a module-dev artifact and stops at the apply seam.
- **Bracket the installer (fallback):** let the generic installer run now (Step 1 already snapshotted), then continue to reconcile.

## Step 3 — Reconcile (merge, never replace)

1. **Registration — merge-not-replace (B1, the must-ship).** Re-run the help-registry merge with the live skills dir so locally-minted rows are preserved, not stripped:

   ```bash
   uv run {project-root}/.claude/skills/vlt-setup/scripts/merge-help-csv.py \
     --target {project-root}/_bmad/module-help.csv \
     --source {project-root}/.claude/skills/vlt-setup/assets/module-help.csv \
     --live-skills-dir {project-root}/.claude/skills \
     --verbose
   ```

   With `--live-skills-dir`, a `vlt` row whose skill is absent from the bundled source but whose **skill dir still exists live** is preserved (a local mint); a row whose dir is gone is a true zombie and still dropped. Confirm the JSON `local_mints_preserved` lists every partner from the Step-1 snapshot. If the JSON reports `header_migrated: true`, the live registry's legacy `after,before` header was renamed in place to the canonical BMad schema (`preceded-by,followed-by` — data rows untouched; one-time, pre-0.5.0 installs only) — note it in the ledger.

2. **Bodies — restore dropped mints (B2, insurance).** For each minted-partner dir in the Step-1 snapshot, confirm it still exists under the live skills dir. If a destructive apply removed one, **restore it** from the snapshot. On the own-the-apply path nothing was deleted, so this is a no-op — but always verify (the cost is a directory check).

3. **Conventions — overlays + baseline.** Overlays in `{overlays}/*.overlay.md` are agent-zone and were never touched — confirm they are intact. Refresh the stock baselines `{overlays}/.baseline/{name}.md` to the newly shipped versions (the new stock reference, used by the next divergence check). For any base recorded as locally-diverged in Step 1, surface it in the report (see Step 4) so the user can lift the change into an overlay or file it upstream.
   - **Overlay-subsumption pass (the upstream rail's return leg).** After the baseline refresh, for each `{overlays}/{name}.overlay.md` diff its sections against the **newly refreshed** base `{conventions}/{name}.md`: where the new base now **covers** an overlay addition (the addition was upstreamed into stock this release), **prompt the user to retire that now-redundant overlay section** — human-gated, never auto-delete (the overlay is the vault's). On retire, record `overlay-subsumption` in `migrations_run` and the ledger Migrations line. This is the missing half of the local-prototype→upstream round trip: `overlay-lift` (Step 3.5) lifts a local base-edit *into* an overlay; subsumption **retires** an overlay once its content has gone the rest of the way (overlay → upstream → base). Without it, an upstreamed overlay persists as a silent shadow definition — `vlt-lint`'s `overlay_not_append_only` only catches *verbatim* heading duplication, so a reworded shadow escapes.

4. **Capabilities — reconcile-not-replace + family propagation.** The capability agent-zone (`{partners}/*/capabilities/`, `{capabilities}/families/`) is never overwritten — confirm every light capability and family contract from the Step-1 snapshot is intact. If a **shipped family's invariants changed** in this upgrade, fire the **propagation check** against the vault's instances (the same discipline as a convention edit's consumer walk): for each instance whose body no longer honors a changed invariant, surface it in the post-flight report (`family_invariant_drift`) for a human to reconcile — never auto-rewrite a partner's body. (Durability and coherence, the same seam — a family invariant change on upgrade *is* Model B's propagation hook firing.)
5. **Migrations — run pending one-time fixups (idempotent).**

   **Relocation-migration discipline (standing — applies to every migration below that moves a file).** A file move is not a plain `git mv`: (a) **never touch parallel-worktree copies; stub the old path.** The vault runs parallel sessions in git worktrees — a `git mv` in one tree leaves stale copies at the old path in every *other* live worktree, which a parallel session can silently keep writing to. So a move touches only the main tree and leaves a **one-line pointer stub at the old path** (append-only records referencing it stay resolvable). (b) **Re-point open dispatch pointers at move time.** `vlt-dispatch` relay dedups on the `(handoff-doc-path, recipient-slug)` pair; moving a doc resets the key, so an un-drained **open** pointer at the old path and a fresh relay at the new path can coexist — so re-point any *open* dispatch pointers from the old path to the new one. Both rules hold for every relocation migration (proto-spec retrofit, decision-log relocation, and any future one).

   - **Decision-log relocation (§A1):** if a legacy `.decision-log.md` exists in `{project-root}/.claude/skills/vlt-mint/`, move its entries into `_agent/mint/decision-log.md` (create if absent) and leave a one-line pointer stub at the old path. Idempotent — a second run finds nothing to move.
   - **Decision-log reconcile (human-gated, post-schema only):** scan `_agent/mint/decision-log.md` for entries recording a gated `convention-edit` (or `upgrade-ruling`) that have **no accounted-for superseding entry** — a gated governance change the log never saw reconciled — and **surface** each one for a human to reconcile. This mirrors the overlay-subsumption pass exactly: **never auto-writes, never auto-restores** (same posture as the "do not auto-restore anything" constraint above). Record `decision-log-reconcile` in `migrations_run` when it fires; if a reconcile results in a file move, follow the relocation-migration discipline above. **Honesty bound:** an entry that predates the decision-log entry schema (`vlt-mint`, *The mint decision log*) carries **no `kind:` field** and cannot be mechanically classified — the scan covers only post-schema (`kind:`-bearing) entries cleanly; each pre-schema entry gets a one-time **"cannot classify — review manually"** surface (`log()`-visible in the post-flight report), never a silent skip and never an auto-write.
   - **Overlay lift (first upgrade):** if Step 1 found base conventions diverged from baseline and no overlays yet exist for them, offer to **lift** the local additions into `{overlays}/{name}.overlay.md` (per-file judgment — additions move to the overlay, the base is restored to pristine stock). This is the one-time exercise that puts an already-diverged vault onto the durable path.
   - **Proto-spec retrofit (human-gated offer):** scan `_agent/handoffs/` for spec-shaped docs — revised in place, carrying "What changed" sections, or with ≥2 relay entries in `_agent/dispatch.md` pointing at the same path — and **offer** the retrofit per `{conventions}/spec.md` (never auto-move; spec-vs-handoff is a judgment call): `git mv` the doc to `{specs}` (default `_agent/specs/`) **per the relocation-migration discipline above** (stub the old path, don't touch worktree copies, re-point open dispatch pointers), and conform its frontmatter to the spec schema with **zero body changes**. On decline, nothing moves. Idempotent — a second run finds nothing spec-shaped left in `_agent/handoffs/`.
   - **Loop-profile relocation (human-gated offer):** scan installed `vlt-agent-*` partners for a **mislocated loop profile** — a loop-profile block (the characteristic keys `root` / `target` / `subject-model` / `data-streams` / `log-tag` / `non-negotiable-gate`, per `vlt-mint/assets/capability-template.md`) that lives **anywhere other than the partner's `capabilities/track.md`**, in a partner that has **no** `capabilities/track.md` heavy pointer. **Detect both observed shapes:** (a) the profile inline in the partner's `SKILL.md` bullet, and (b) a **separate `### Loop profile` section** in the SKILL.md referenced from elsewhere in the file — a scan keyed to only one shape misses the other. **Offer** (never auto-move; per-partner judgment) to lift the profile into the partner's `capabilities/track.md` (create the heavy pointer `procedure: { skill: vlt-track }` if absent, per the template), leaving the source location a one-line pointer to the new home. Model this on the **overlay-lift** offer above — it is a content *lift* into the correct home, not a file *move*, so the relocation discipline's stub/re-point rules apply only insofar as any old path reference must stay resolvable. Record `loop-profile-relocation` in `migrations_run`. **Idempotent** — a partner already carrying its profile in `capabilities/track.md` yields nothing; a second run finds nothing mislocated.
   - Run any other migrations the new version documents.

6. **Provision — hand off to `vlt-setup`.** Invoke `vlt-setup` (reconfigure branch) to ensure structure, governance bundle, workflows, the new agent-zone homes (`_agent/conventions/`, `_agent/mint/`, `_agent/capabilities/families/`), and the **generic-BMad installer cache seed** (vlt-setup Provision §5 — refreshed each upgrade so the installer's view of `module.yaml` tracks the installed version) are present. `vlt-upgrade` calls it; it does not duplicate provisioning.

7. **Upgrade-time rulings — write them through (never the ledger alone).** The general rule, stated once here where upgrade-time rulings happen: **an upgrade-time user ruling propagates to the mint decision log *and* to any governing prose whose assertions it changes — never the upgrade ledger alone.** A ruling made during this upgrade (an overlay retirement, a base-divergence lift, a family-invariant reconcile, a convention edit accepted mid-upgrade — any decision that changes what governance asserts) records in **two** places: (a) a dated entry in the **mint decision log** (`_agent/mint/decision-log.md`), and (b) the **governing prose** whose assertions the ruling changes (a convention base, a skill's stated rule). Recording it only in the upgrade ledger (Step 5) leaves the decision log and the governing prose asserting a stale reality — the misattribution the class of defects behind this rule comes from. The decision-log **entry shape** — the schema *and* the supersession idiom for a ruling that supersedes an earlier logged decision — is single-homed in `vlt-mint`, *The mint decision log*: **follow it; do not restate the entry mechanics here.** Record `decision-log-write` in `migrations_run` when a ruling is written through. *(This is detect-and-record, not the refuse-to-proceed posture — the current contract at "does not auto-merge either" stands unchanged.)*
   - **First two instances of this rule:** (a) the `vlt-core` firewall ruling that should have superseded the decision log (`_agent/upgrade-ledger.md` firewall entry) — its superseding decision-log entry is written when next reconciled; (b) an upgrade/mint-time ruling that changes a convention base (e.g. the extraction naming gate) must also reach the log, not the ledger alone. The two fixes remain separable — only a convention *rule* change additionally carries the `version:` handshake.

## Step 4 — Post-flight divergence report

Report in a parseable summary so the user sees exactly what changed and what needs their attention:

```yaml
upgrade:
  from_version: <prev>            # module_version before
  to_version: <new>              # module_version after
  apply_path: own | bracket
  mints_preserved: [<vlt-agent-x>, ...]      # registration kept
  bodies_restored: [<vlt-agent-x>, ...]      # B2 — empty on the own path
  overlays_intact: [<name.overlay.md>, ...]
  baselines_refreshed: [<name>, ...]
  base_divergence: [<convention: base was hand-edited (prev content preserved in ledger) — lift to overlay or upstream>, ...]
  skill_asset_divergence: [<path: shipped skill asset was hand-edited (prev content preserved in ledger) — re-apply locally or upstream | skill_manifest_missing (seeded this run)>, ...]
  migrations_run: [decision-log-relocation | overlay-lift | proto-spec-retrofit | overlay-subsumption | decision-log-reconcile | decision-log-write | loop-profile-relocation | <other>, ...]
  governance_divergence: [<file differs from shipped — review>, ...]
  capabilities_intact: [<partner/slug>, <family>, ...]            # vault-grown caps + family contracts preserved
  family_invariant_drift: [<family: instance <partner> no longer honors invariant X — reconcile>, ...]
```

`base_divergence`, `skill_asset_divergence`, and `governance_divergence` are the **detect-and-report** safety net (filing #8 B3): the upgrade never silently clobbers a local edit without surfacing it — but it does not auto-merge either (overlays make that unnecessary going forward for conventions; a hand-edited base or skill asset is the user's to re-express or re-apply).

## Step 5 — The standing divergence ledger

`{upgrade_ledger}` (default `_agent/upgrade-ledger.md`) is an **append-only standing record** of how far this vault has drifted from stock — read it between upgrades to see the vault's evolution over time. It is agent-zone (durable) and **never rewritten**: each upgrade appends one dated block. Create it lazily on first upgrade with a title line, then append:

```markdown
# Upgrade Ledger

_How this vault has evolved from stock, one upgrade at a time. Append-only — faithful appending yields **strict oldest-first**; a file whose dated blocks are out of order has been hand-edited (trust the dates, not the position)._

## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] vlt <from_version> → <to_version> (<apply_path>)
- Mints preserved: <list>            # local partners kept registered
- Bodies restored: <list or none>    # B2
- Overlays: <list of *.overlay.md>   # local convention additions, durable
- Base divergence: <list or none>    # hand-edited bases surfaced (prev content quoted/linked)
- Skill-asset divergence: <list or none>   # hand-edited shipped skill files surfaced (prev content quoted/linked)
- Migrations: <list or none>
- Governance divergence: <list or none>
- Notes: <anything the user should remember>
```

Pass the timestamp in explicitly (the agent knows the date on activation). The opening half is appended at pre-flight; the entry is completed at post-flight.

## This skill does not…

- **Reimplement `vlt-setup`.** Provisioning is `vlt-setup`'s job; `vlt-upgrade` calls it.
- **Control the generic installer.** Whether the installer clean-replaces or copies-over is external and unknowable from here; the prefer-own/degrade-to-bracket design makes that unknown irrelevant — own the apply when possible, reconcile defensively when not.
- **Auto-merge a hand-edited base convention.** Overlays prevent that collision going forward; an existing base hand-edit is surfaced (report + ledger) for the user to lift into an overlay or upstream. It never silently overwrites without recording the prior content.
- **Touch the human zones or PARA.** Same boundaries as every partner — `_agent/` and `_meta/` only.

## Verify

Before closing: the live `module-help.csv` still carries every locally-minted partner row (Step 3.1 JSON confirms) and its header is the canonical BMad schema; every minted-partner dir from the Step-1 snapshot still exists (Step 3.2); every `{overlays}/*.overlay.md` is intact; `_agent/mint/decision-log.md` exists (relocation done if a legacy file was present); the skill-asset manifest `{overlays}/.baseline/.skill-manifest` exists and was refreshed to the shipped versions (via the Step-6 provision); the ledger has a new dated block; the post-flight report names any base/skill-asset/governance divergence for the user. **Every gated ruling made during this upgrade has a corresponding entry in `_agent/mint/decision-log.md` (Step 3.7) — the upgrade cannot close while a recorded gated ruling reached only the ledger; and any pre-schema decision-log entry the reconcile pass could not classify is surfaced, not silently skipped.** Then offer to commit.
